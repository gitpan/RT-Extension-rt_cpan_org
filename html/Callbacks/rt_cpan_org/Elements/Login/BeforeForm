      This site tracks bugs in every distribution released through
      <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To report bugs in perl itself, you're best off using the command-line 'perlbug' tool or
      <a href="http://rt.perl.org">rt.perl.org.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      This site lets you <a href="<% $RT::WebBaseURL %>/Public/?nossl=true">search for distributions</a> by name or author.  When you've found the
      distribution you're looking for, you can browse known bugs and report new bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
      To work with bugs, every module author with a <a href="http://pause.perl.org">PAUSE</a>
      account can log into rt.cpan.org with their PAUSE userid and password.  If you can't
      log in or distributions you maintain aren't listed, please write to
      <a href="mailto:rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com">rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com</a>
      at your earliest convenience.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions <b>about rt.cpan.org</b>, feel free to send mail to
      <a href="mailto:rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com">rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com</a> and
      we'll do our best to get back to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      To submit a bug report for a given distribution by email, send mail to
      <strong>bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org</strong>, where
      "&lt;distribution-name&gt;" is something like DBIx-SearchBuilder or
      Class-DBI or Acme-Current-Forever.
    </p>
